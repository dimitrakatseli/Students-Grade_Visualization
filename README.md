# Students-Grade_Visualization
For this Project we will use kaggle which contains students information and their grades at various exams. 

Project

In this project what we are aiming for is to find relationships  between the data of the students so that we can conclude to what aspects relate to the grade they get so that the teachers, the parents and the government has to emphasise on these in order for students to have better grades. For example it is is usually being said that females are not so good at Mathematics and Men are better. But is it really true? Also we want  to know if the income correlates with the grade. One also important thing is to know whether or not the educational level of the parents of the student has an impact on its grade. One more interesting aspect to check is whether or not taking a preparation test has an impact on the grade.
